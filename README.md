### Working directory

We will be using `~/workspace` for all the exercises. Setup that
directory now.

```bash
mkdir ~/workspace
cd ~/workspace
```

### IntelliJ

We strongly recommend using [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
as your IDE.
There is a free [Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html)
that will work well for our exercises.

## The Exercise

Get the tests to pass!

- Create a GitHub repository called `jump-start`.
- Download the source code into a directory called `jump-start` in your
  `workspace` directory that your created above.
- Replace `continuumcollective` with your GitHub username for each of
  the README links in the table on top.
- Get the tests to pass. Keep it simple.

Welcome to the weekend!

Thanks, @barinek
