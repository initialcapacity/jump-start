### Working directory

We will be using `~/workspace` for all the exercises.
Create that directory now.

```bash
mkdir ~/workspace
cd ~/workspace
```

### IntelliJ

We strongly recommend using [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
as your IDE.
There is a free [Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html)
that will work well for our exercises.

## The Exercise

Get the tests to pass!

-   Create a GitHub repository called `jump-start`.
-   Download the source code into a directory called `jump-start` in
    your `workspace` directory that your created above.
-   Replace `continuumcollective` with your GitHub username for each of
    the README links in the table on top.
-   Get the tests to pass.
    Keep it simple.

Welcome to the weekend!

Thanks, @barinek
