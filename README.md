## Before we start

Don't worry about any missing or broken links above just yet - we'll be creating the repos
and enabling the links over the weekend.

Let's take a quick look at the tech stack we'll be using for the exercises.

|Topic|Tool|
|:---|:---|
|Project planning|[Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/)|
|Package manager|[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for MacOS, [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) for Windows, [Apt](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt) for Debian-Based Linux|
|Language|[Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)|
|Build tool|[Gradle](https://gradle.org/)|
|Testing tools|[JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/), [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/)|
|Data persistence|[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)|
|Messaging|[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)|
|Continuous integration|[GitHub](https://github.com/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)|
|Continuous delivery|[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)|

## Working directory

We'll be using a `~/workspace` directory for all the exercises. Let's setup that directory now.

```bash
mkdir ~/workspace
cd ~/workspace
```

## IntelliJ

We strongly recommend using [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as your IDE. There is a free
[Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html)
that will work well for our exercises.

## The Exercise

Get the tests to pass!

- Download the source code
- Create a directory and GitHub repository for this exercise in `~/workspace`
- Replace `continuumcollective` with your GitHub username for each of the below README links.
- Get the tests to pass

Welcome to the weekend!

Thanks, @barinek
